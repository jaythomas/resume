Guiding Principles
------------------

- **Innovation in my ideas.** I’m always trying out new things and working to keep my toolset sharp.
- **Thoroughness in my code.** One of the most important parts of writing code is feeling proud that what you’ve written not only does the expected behavior, but goes beyond the here and now. Test-driven development is one example of this. I often set a high standard in my tests, forcing myself to account for all the many ways a user can break the code.
- **Cooperation with my team.** I like to know that I’m working with standardized practices and design patterns. It’s nearly impossible to be successful when developers are not on the same page with design concepts. For example, I like to use the principles of [The Twelve-Factor App] for web application platforms and [semVer] for my versioning.
